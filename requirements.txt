# Note: `pycloc` was removed because it isn't available on PyPI (pip install fails).
# Alternatives you can use for counting lines of code or metrics:
# - cloc (command-line, good for many languages): `brew install cloc` then `cloc /path`
# - pygount (Python package): `pip install pygount` then `pygount /path`
# - radon (Python metrics, LOC & complexity): `pip install radon` then `radon raw -s /path`
